Binding and mutability
1. ðŸŒŸ A variable can be used only if it has been initialized.
// Fix the error below with least amount of modification to the code
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5; // Uninitialized but used, ERROR !
    let y: i32; // Uninitialized but also unused, only a Warning !

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
}

2. ðŸŒŸ Use mut to mark a variable as mutable.
// Fill the blanks in the code to make it compile
fn main() {
    let mut x =  1;
    x += 2; 
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("Success!");
}

Scope
A scope is the range within the program for which the item is valid.

3. ðŸŒŸ
// Fix the error below with least amount of modification
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    {
        let y: i32 = 5;
        println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y);
    }
    println!("The value of x is {}", x); 
}

4. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
// Fix the error with the use of define_x
fn main() {
    let x = define_x(); 
    println!("{}, world", x); 
}

fn define_x() -> String {
    let x = "hello".to_string();
    x
}

Shadowing
You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, here we can say **the first one is shadowed by the second one.

5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
// Only modify `assert_eq!` to make the `println!` work(print `42` in terminal)
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    {
        let x = 12;
        assert_eq!(x, 12);
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 5);

    let x =  42;
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "42".
}

6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
// Remove a line in the code to make it compile
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 7;
    // Shadowing and re-binding
    let x = x; 
    let y = 4;
    // Shadowing
    let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; 

    println!("Success!");
}
* the answer provide in "solutions" (github sunface) did not make sense to me because it removed 2 lines of code (not A line) and when copy/pasted into rust playground had errors and no result

Unused variables
7. Fix the warning below with :
ðŸŒŸ Only one solution
ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Two distinct solutions
Note: none of the solutions is to remove the line let x = 1
fn main() {
    let _x = 1; 
}

// Warning: unused variable: `x`

Destructuring
8. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ We can use a pattern with let to destructure a tuple to separate variables.
Tips: you can use Shadowing or Mutability
// Fix the error below with least amount of modification
fn main() {
    let (mut x, mut y) = (1, 2);
    x += 2;

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}

Destructuring assignments
Introduced in Rust 1.59: You can now use tuple, slice, and struct patterns as the left-hand side of an assignment.

9. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
Note: the feature Destructuring assignments need 1.59 or higher Rust version

fn main() {
    let (x, y);
    (x,..) = (3, 4);
    [.., y] = [1, 2];
    // Fill the blank to make the code work
    assert_eq!([x,y], [3,2]);

    println!("Success!");
} 


//i was unable to answer most of these questions on my own.  i went back to read chapter 3 from the rust programming language after july 9 class.  i've asked people for recommended readings and practice.  if you have another other recommendations please let me know.  i'm willing to put in the work but need some guidance.
